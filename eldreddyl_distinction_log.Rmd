Thursday, November 4
- Hours worked today: 2 
- Current tasks: Finding available data, browsing current literature
- Goals: Find a compatible data set that includes healt insurance types and utilization by state
- Reflection: Today I found a promising data set from the BRFSS. It consisted of a questionnaire that covered state of residence, health insurance coverage type and status, and utilization of different services. I also created this GitHub repository as a way to organize my files and to document my progress on this progress. For next week, I am going to review current literature to try and devise a method for regression.
