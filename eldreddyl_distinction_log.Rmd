- Reflection: Today I finished calculating the summary statistics for age, income, union membership, % working in a risky occupation. When I ran my initial regression including the entire sample. I did get results similar to Simon's paper. Instead of coverage rates decreasing, they increased. For next time, I'm going to look into the interaction term variables. I need to include small group with the policy variables (rpost1, rpost2, rpost3). Then after I run the probit model, I need to calculate the marginal effects.
