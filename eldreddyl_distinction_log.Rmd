    - Soft:  Literature Review (4/5/22)
- Reflection: I still wasn't getting coefficients on my interaction terms to match the Simon results. I believe this may be due to me coding the timing of the reforms incorrectly. I took table 1 from Simon (2005) and stored the timing in an Excel spreadsheet. Currently, I am in the process of importing the spreadsheet into python so that I can output Stata code that will correctly time the reforms

- Reflection: Today I finished calculating the summary statistics for age, income, union membership, % working in a risky occupation. When I ran my initial regression including the entire sample. I did get results similar to Simon's paper. Instead of coverage rates decreasing, they increased. For next time, I'm going to look into the interaction term variables. I need to include small group with the policy variables (rpost1, rpost2, rpost3). Then after I run the probit model, I need to calculate the marginal effects.
